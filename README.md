The OmniCookBook ReadMe File -

This project is fully open source, and anyone may copy, clone, or use it in any way they deem fit. Anything a CC0 (Creative Commons Zero) would grant is applicable.

This project is just a website, so to access it you must go to

https://amazing-cassata-01b608.netlify.app

To use the website just search up an ingredient. It will give basic details on the ingredient you search up. This api has unlimited calls.

Go to my fridge to browse ingredients and recipes, from here you can add them to your meal planner.  The Recipe Browser that we ended up going with only allows us 50 calls a day, so if they give an api call limit that is why. If that happens we would like to request you try again the next day for grading related to it.

Lastly the meal planner does what its name says. Anything sent from the fridge will be viewable over here. The current planner data is saved locally to your browser.
